About:
------

f2bgl is a re-implementation of the engine used in the game Fade To Black
made by Delphine Software and released in 1995.


Compiling:
----------

Update the defines in the Makefile if needed. The SDL and OpenGL libraries
are required.


Running:
--------

You will need the original files of the PC release or PC demo.

By default, the program will try to load the game data files from the current
directory. The expected directory structure is :

	TRIGO.DAT   - optional
	DATA/
	DATA/SOUND/
	TEXT/       - not present with demo version
	VOICE/      - not present with demo version

Defaults can be changed using command line switches :

    Usage: f2b [OPTIONS]...
    --datapath=PATH             Path to data files (default 'DATA')
    --language=EN|FR|GR|SP|IT   Language files to use (default 'EN')
    --playdemo                  Use inputs from .DEM files
    --level=NUM                 Start at level NUM
